# Exploring the dev environment 

At this point you should have a few things that you can run:

1. The databases
2. 2 Django projects
3. `airflow standalone`

If anything isn't set up then we'll get stuck later so it'll be good to be sure that it all works.

## In a terminal...

Open up a terminal and do the following:

```
cd src
source venv/bin/activate 

airflow standalone
```

## Let's see how observant you are...

- what database is Airflow using by default? 
- what url and port is the webserver listening at?
- where can you find the default admin password?
- is Airflow standalone suitable for production?

## Log in as admin

- http://0.0.0.0:8080/
